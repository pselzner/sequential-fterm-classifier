PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To construct a foundation of development of a new medicine by inhibiting an interaction between SH3 domain and its ligand. SOLUTION: An inhibition of an interaction between SH3 domain and its ligand bonded in high affinity by transducing a vector to express an eugenic negative mutant of c-Src SH3 domain to a cell and using a peptide to inhibit the interaction is shown to exhibit a foundation of development of a new medicine.<START F-TERMS>2G045/AA40,2G045/CB02,2G045/CB21,2G045/DA36,2G045/DA77,2G045/FB02,2G045/FB07,4B024/AA01,4B024/AA11,4B024/BA10,4B024/BA80,4B024/CA02,4B024/CA07,4B024/EA02,4B024/EA04,4B024/FA02,4B024/GA11,4B024/HA01,4B063/QA01,4B063/QA05,4B063/QQ08,4B063/QQ13,4B063/QQ22,4B063/QQ79,4B063/QR02,4B063/QR33,4B063/QR48,4B063/QR77,4B063/QR80,4B063/QR82,4B063/QS24,4B063/QS36,4C084/AA17,4C084/NA14,4C084/ZB26,
