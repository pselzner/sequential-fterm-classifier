PURPOSE:To detect the quantity of the hydrogen absorbed by iron or steel by joining one end of V, Nb or Ta in a space formed in the iron or steel, thickening the hydrogen permeated in the iron or steel from a hydrogen infiltration atmosphere and measuring the change in electric resistivity. CONSTITUTION:The iron or steel 2 is welded to the iron or steel 1 to form the space and a hydrogen detecting metal 3 of high-purity V, Nb or Ta is joined to the iron or steel 2 in this space. Terminals 61 to 64 for measuring the electric resistivity are joined to the metal 3 and the holes in which the terminals 61 to 64 penetrate the iron or steel are hermetically sealed by insulating seals 51 to 54. The outer side of the iron or steel 2 is then exposed to the hydrogen infiltration atmosphere and the hydrogen is permeated through the joint surfaces. The hydrogen infiltering the metal 3 is thickened in the metal and the electric resistivity is changed. The change in this electric resistivity is measured, by which the hydrogen quantity is detected. The quantity of the hydrogen absorbed by the iron or steel is detected in this way.<START F-TERMS>2G060/AA10,2G060/AB03,2G060/AF07,2G060/BD08,2G060/KA01,
