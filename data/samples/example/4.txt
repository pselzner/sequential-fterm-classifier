PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a jig pallet capable of coping with a great variety of workpiece shapes. SOLUTION: In a jig pallet 1 provided with a workpiece clamping device 2 performing an unclamping action by fluid pressure, the jig pallet 1 is formed on the upper surface with a T-shaped groove 11. A T-shaped nut 14 is slidably engaged with the T-shaped groove 11a and a clamp device 2 is fixed to the jig pallet 1 by a fixing bolt 15 engaging the T-shaped nut 14. Further, a plurality of fluid supply ports 12a communicating to a fluid path 12 provided in the jig pallet 1 are opened to the bottom surface of the T-shaped groove 14, and an unclamping fluid introduction port provided in the clamp device 2 is connected to the fluid supply port 12a through a flexible pipe F.<START F-TERMS>3C016/CA01,3C016/CB02,3C016/CC01,3C016/CD02,
