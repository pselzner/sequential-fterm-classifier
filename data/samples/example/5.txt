PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide high vacuum force with less energy consumption and in a simple operation method, by placing a press-in-type hand pump mechanism that performs a suction operation by a press-in operation on the upper surface side of a body, and communicating its suction hole to the inside of the body through a check valve. SOLUTION: A movable plate 50 is formed in a substantial cup shape, and stores a seal member 58 while enabling an intermediate shaft 41 to be inserted into its bottom. Thus, even when the movable plate 50 is vertically slid in a state where the intermediate shaft 41 is inserted, an airtight state is maintained. A seal member 43 of an intermediate plate 40 is formed so as to tightly abut to the inner peripheral surface of the sidewall of the movable plate 50, and therefore, when the movable plate 50 is vertically moved in a state where the intermediate plate 40 is fixed, volume of a sealed space surrounded by them increases or decreases. Therefore, a plate-shaped portion of the intermediate plate 40 constitutes a fixed pump body, and the movable plate 50 constitutes a movable pump body. Because a press-in operation from the upside of a container is used, a force is easy to be applied.<START F-TERMS>3E067/AA11,3E067/AB01,3E067/BA01,3E067/BC07,3E067/EE56,3E067/EE60,3E067/FB11,3E067/GD01,3E067/GD02,4B002/AA01,4B002/AA21,4B002/BA01,4B002/BA21,4B002/BA41,4B002/BA53,4B002/BA59,4B002/CA11,4B002/CA22,4B002/CA23,4B002/CA32,
