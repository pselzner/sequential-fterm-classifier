PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To obtain a spinning oil agent which does not generate tars and scum even on a false twisting processing of either of a hot plate contact heating type and a non-contact heating type using a radiant heat type high temperature heater. SOLUTION: This spinning oiling agent for synthetic fibers contains a polyether-based lubricant and a polyether-based antistatic agent having a polyoxyalkylene chain, has a black board method turbidity of <=15 in a non- aqueous state, and has a black board method turbidity change of <=7 after centrifuged at 30 deg.C under 15,000G for 8 hr.<START F-TERMS>4L033/AA04,4L033/AB01,4L033/AC06,4L033/AC15,4L033/CA48,4L045/AA05,4L045/BA03,4L045/DA44,4L045/DA53,
