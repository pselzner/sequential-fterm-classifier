PURPOSE: To provide an attenuator for industrial sewing machine capable of attenuating horizontal and vertical vibrations and supporting the upper part of a sewing machine on a base without play. CONSTITUTION: The attenuator is provided between an upper part 1 of the sewing machine and a base 2, and this attenuator is composed of a rubber-metal bush 10 for attenuating horizontal and vertical vibrations and a rubber-metal buffer 11 for attenuating vertical vibrations. The rubber-metal bush 10 supported by a hold bolt 19 forms a hinge-shaped connecting spot 20, which belongs to the attenuator, adjustable without play by fastening. When a screw 26 is unfastened and this connecting spot 20 is unfastened, the upper part 1 of the sewing machine can fall at a falling position. When the screw 26 is fastened, a lock connecting member 27 blocks the fall of the upper part of the sewing machine so that the destruction of the rubber-metal bush 10 can be avoided.<START F-TERMS>3B150/CE26,3B150/CE28,3B150/GA04,3B150/HA01,3B150/HA04,3B150/HA18,
